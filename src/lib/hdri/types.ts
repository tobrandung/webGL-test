/**
 * Shared types for the HDRI conversion pipeline.
 *
 * This module and its pure siblings — `half`, `colorspace`, `resample`, `rgbe`,
 * `exr-header`, `format` — import nothing but each other, and only via explicit
 * `.ts` specifiers. That is what lets `scripts/convert-hdri.ts` run the very
 * same files under Node (whose native type stripping needs the extension and
 * knows nothing about Vite's `@` alias) while the app imports them through the
 * bundler. Anything that needs `three` or the DOM belongs in a sibling below
 * that line, not here.
